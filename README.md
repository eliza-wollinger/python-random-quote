# Simple Random Quote Generator

This is a simple Python project that generates random quotes from a text file. It can be a fun way to get inspirational or humorous quotes at random. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

### Installation

1. Clone the project to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-quote-generator.git
cd random-quote-generator
```

2. Place your collection of quotes in a text file named quotes.txt. Each quote should be on a separate line.

### Usage

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the script by executing the following command:

```
python random-quote-generator.py
```

The script will read the quotes from the quotes.txt file and print a random quote to the console.

### Example

Suppose your **quotes.txt** file contains the following quotes:

```
"The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." - Winston Churchill
"Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans." - John Lennon
```

Running the script will display a random quote from the file:

```
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." - Winston Churchill
```

### Customization

You can modify the **quotes.txt** file to include your favorite quotes or add new quotes. Simply ensure that each quote is on a separate line within the file.
